            The only other bear similar in size to the polar bear is the Kodiak bear, which is a subspecies of brown bear.[52] Adult male polar bears weigh 350‚Äì700 kg (770‚Äì1,500 lb) and measure 2.4‚Äì3 metres (7 ft 10 in‚Äì9 ft 10 in) in total length.[53] Around the Beaufort Sea, however, mature males reportedly average 450 kg (1,000 lb).
